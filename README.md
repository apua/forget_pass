forget_pass
===========

It just a practice to write apps in PHP.

It contains two components: forget_pass and settings. where forget_pass is used for users who forget password and want to reset password by answer customized question, and settings is used for setting customzised question and answer.

This is not useful but just my officer ask for it. Since my partners don't use any framework and only write PHP manually, I take it as another practice....
